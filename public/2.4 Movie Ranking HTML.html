<h1>A Few of My Favorite Films</h1>
<h2>Top 4 Movies, In No Particular Order</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Fury</h3>
<p>This is a great war film that really shows the cunning, stress, and horrors of living & working in a tank during WWII.</p>
<h3>Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</h3>
<p>This is a classic comedy IMO. It combines my favorite comedic duo with NASCAR, what's not to like?</p>
<h3>Dodgeball</h3>
<p>Another great comedy movie from my childhood. I really connect with this film because of the underdog storyline and my love for dodgeball.
</p>
<h3>Ironman</h3>
<p>This is my all time favorite superhero movie. This is the film that got me interested in the Marvel Universe. Plus Robert Downey Jr. is a straight up G.</p>
